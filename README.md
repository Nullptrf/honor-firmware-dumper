# HONOR FIRMWARE DUMPER
A tool for dumping Honor devices firmware.

### How to Install the Firmware Zip File from Dload:

### Requirements:
* A USB stick with 10-12GB of free space (with exFAT format).
* An Honor phone with at least 60% battery or fully charged.

### Warnings:
* Proceed at your own risk.
* All your data, including pictures, will be erased!
* ⚠️💀 Do not interrupt the process.
* ⚠️💀 Do not unplug the USB stick during the installation! Otherwise, the phone may be permanently damaged.
* Downgrading to previous version might not be possible.

### Installation Steps (Follow Carefully):
1. Download the firmware for your device from the link provided on the Telegram channel (Telegram: [@honorfirmwares](https://t.me/honorfirmwares)).
2. Extract the firmware zip file.
3. Open the extracted zip file and locate the *dload* folder. Copy this folder to the USB stick.
   - Ensure the *dload* folder is not inside any other folder (it should be in the root directory of the USB stick).
4. Once the copying is complete, use `umount` to safely eject the USB stick and ensure the files copied successfully.
5. Unplug the USB stick from your PC and connect it to your target Honor phone.
6. On your Honor phone, open the phone app and enter this code: `*#*#2846579#*#*`. You will access the `ProjectMenu`. Select `Software Upgrade -> Memory Card Upgrade`, ensuring the USB stick is plugged into your phone. (If you see an MIT error, don’t worry; it’s not an issue.)
7. The phone will reboot into recovery mode, and the installation will begin.

### That's It!
